Interview preparations are hard. Software Engineering interviews require
dedicated preparation and a lot practice to make sure you can meet
expectations and beat the competition.

I have been through this journey myself and I can guide you on your
journey.

Here is what I can do :
 - Walk you through problems.
 - Solve algorithmic problems while explaining approaches to you.
 - Tell you what you are doing wrong and how to approach these problems.

Languages that I know and I can help you in:
 - Java
 - Python
 - Scala
 - SQL

Roles I can help you prepare for:
 - Software Engineer (Backend)
 - Software Engineer (Data)
 - Data Analyst / Engineer
