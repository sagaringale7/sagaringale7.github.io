If you need continuous help over the next few weeks / months,
or on a short term project, or dedicated on-demand help
for only a few hours every month, we can work out a number
of recurring subscription plans.

This is typically designed for professionals seeking assistance
regularly to prepare for interviews, or for projects where
some expert guidance in time can help speed up the time to
develop the product.

I usually schedule multiple recurring sessions over a period
of time. Eg, 10 hrs or 20 hrs a month / fortnight, for a price.
