Hello, I am Anish.

I am a Software Development Engineer, and I love data, which gives me the nice hat of a Data Engineer.

My current area of expertise is Data Processing, Big Data, SQL and Functional Programming.

I started coding back in high school and have since maintained a deep interest in coding and now I engineer data products.

I am currently working full time as a Data Engineer at Spotify AB, based out of Stockholm, Sweden.

I also mentor others and provide help in solving problems in the world of Data.
For online sessions I work through [CodeMentor](https://www.codementor.io/anish749)  [![Book session on Codementor](https://cdn.codementor.io/badges/book_session_github.svg)](https://www.codementor.io/anish749?utm_source=github&utm_medium=button&utm_term=anish749&utm_campaign=github)

Other than coding I also maintain a deep interest in films and photography as a hobby. Do have a look at my other blog at [Visual Krafts](https://visualkrafts.wordpress.com/) though it is a bit old and not updated frequently!

For a detailed CV please have a look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anishchakraborty) profile.
