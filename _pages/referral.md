If you have landed on this page, it is probably from LinkedIn
and / or you have approached me for a referral.

I currently work at Spotify and I would be glad to refer you to an
open position at Spotify if that matches your career ambition and you
have the skills that we need. However it is great to know how referrals
work in general so that you have the right expectations and you are well
prepared.

Please note, that the views in this page are my personal opinion, and I
am not an official spokesperson of Spotify.

Do read [this](https://hrblog.spotify.com/2017/02/17/how-to-get-a-job-at-spotify/)
blog post about working at Spotify, and also search for "referral" in the post
before approaching me for a referral.

To summarize:

What is a referral and why does this exist:

Employees have networks and they know if someone fits a role, and hence
they can send an application. That is a referral. This doesn't mean that
a referral would be prioritized over a non referred application. This
also does not guarantee that you would get an interview because you were
referred. However it is ensured that you are never interviewed by your
referrer, because they might be biased towards to you. I am glad that
Spotify is not an exclusive workplace where internal
employee referrals get prioritized. We are a diverse and inclusive
company and your interview and hiring process would happen independent
of how you applied. Whether your spouse or your friend works at Spotify
would have NO role to play in your hiring process.

For a referral from me:

Look for a suitable opening on www.spotifyjobs.com, and if you see something
that suits you and you believe that you are a good fit for that, share
me a link of that job along with your contact details. No LinkedIn job postings
please. I can't refer you with your LinkedIn profile :\

If you have already applied at www.spotifyjobs.com, there
is no need for me to refer you again, your application is already being
considered.

And I am always glad and eager to refer you, do contact me if you think
it would help you. :D
