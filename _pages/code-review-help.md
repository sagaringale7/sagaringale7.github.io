You have already started working on this system or a data product, and
now things are stuck. You have some part of your system built and are
looking for help on deciding on the next steps or the quality of the
system that you have built.

I can come in and help you make better decisions using my expertise
and also review your code to catch bugs early or to make sure that
your code is extensible and easy to maintain in the long run.

I have experience with designing and maintaining large scale systems
with code bases which are millions of lines.
