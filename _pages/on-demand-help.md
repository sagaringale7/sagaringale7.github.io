Hiring experts in all fields for experimental project is expensive. And
on the other hand hiring non-experts can severely increase the lead time
of a project.

This is where I can help in. I can provide on demand expertise and help
to speed up things whenever needed.

I have previously helped teams and projects when they most needed help,
but for a very short period of time to get the ball rolling and then
things go on well.

My experience in designing large scale projects are primarily in
backend infrastructure, data engineering, data infrastructure,
data analysis and data science. I have also worked expensively with
AWS and GCP products.
